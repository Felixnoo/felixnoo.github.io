## Overview

As the very first post on this website, I think it should help me set out on the journey to practice my writing skills.

The very first thing is to make sure I can always remember how I set up the website from scratch...

## Set Website Up

### Simple!

Make sure to:

1. have a GitHub account
2. [learn to create a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

Now, the website should be ready! To push the simple method forward a little bit, I'm thinking about using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

### Hugo My Site

To Hugo my site, I need to follow the document of [Host on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), and change the site title by editing `config.toml`.

[This repository](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) may come in handy when configuring the site...

If the GitHub Action fails, try to check the error message, and it may be caused by insufficient permission that can be changed in **Settings** > **Actions** > **General** > **Workflow permissions**.

If everything works just fine, my site powered by Hugo should be ready by now!

## Step Forward

Learn more about Hugo, and practice, practice, practice more.
