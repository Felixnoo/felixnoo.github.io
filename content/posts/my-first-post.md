## Overview

As the very first post on this website, I think it should help me set out on my adventure.

The very first thing is to make sure I can always remember how I set up the website from scratch...

## Set Website Up

### Simple!

Make sure to:

1. have a GitHub account
2. [learn to create a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

Now, the website should be ready! To push me forward a little bit, I'm thinking about using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

### Hugo My Site

To Hugo my site, I need to follow the document of [Host on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), and change the site title by editing `config.toml`.

[This repository](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) may come in handy when configuring the site...

If the GitHub Action fails, try to check the error message, and it may be caused by insufficient permission. I can make necessary changes in **Settings** > **Actions** > **General** > **Workflow permissions**.

If everything works just fine, my site powered by Hugo should be ready by now!

## Step Forward

Learn more about Hugo, and practice, practice, practice more.
